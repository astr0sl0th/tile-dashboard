# A configurable dashboard with a tile like feel

[Demo](https://css-grid-tile-react-dashboard.netlify.app/)

## Features

- Uses [CSSGrid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
- Custom backgrounds for each tile/grid item
- Set the amount of grid columns
- Point free style react because f***k all you OOP lot learn math ffs!

## Magic involved

The trick to the full screen background per tile is due to wonderful css property 'background attachment: 'fixed' this allows the background image or color to extend over selected rows/columns. I know crazy right üòù
